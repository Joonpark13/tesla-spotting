# Tesla Spotting

The though process went as follows:
 - Oh hey, look, it's a Tesla!
 - Oh hey, look, it's another Tesla!
 - Gee, I've seen a lot of Teslas this week... I wish I could easily keep track of
    when and where I've seen them.
 - Wait, I could make an app for that!
 - I don't know app development... well, I guess this is a great excuse to teach
    myself [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)! (I'm a huge
    fan of React)

And thus, this app was born.
